# Assembly Line Balancing – Excel-Based Mini Project

This project analyzes a 5-station assembly line to evaluate workload balance and calculate efficiency.

## 🔍 Objective
To visually and numerically assess the workload distribution across stations using Excel and basic formulas.

## 🛠 Tools
- Microsoft Excel
- Manual calculations (for efficiency)
- Bar Chart for workload visualization

## 📊 Results
- Total tasks: 10  
- Total operation time: 495 seconds  
- Number of stations: 5  
- Most loaded station time: 120 seconds  
- **Efficiency: 82.5%**

## 📂 Files
- `assembly_line_data.xlsx`: Task durations and station assignments
- `efficiency_chart.png`: Workload distribution bar chart

## ✅ Outcome
- Identified bottleneck: Station 4  
- Suggestion: Re-distribute tasks for balance
